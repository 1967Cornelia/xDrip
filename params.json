(kinda!)](http://bit.ly/1LdmZiN)\r\n\r\n* No plugging things into your receiver or your phone, phone can be used as a normal phone!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Complete with NightScout Support!!!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0aJkm5e.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0aJkm5e.jpg\" align=\"left\" width=\"800\" ></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Currently there are 2 parts\r\n* one is the [Relay/Bridge](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/wixel-xDrip) [(the wixel and bluetooth component)](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/xDrip/blob/gh-pages/hardware_setup.md) which catches Dexcom transmissions them and then sends them out over BT\r\n\r\n* The second part is the [Android App](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/xDrip), this receives that data and graphs it out for you (and allows you to enter calibrations)\r\n\r\n* Both are available and ready for you to use!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pictures\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8xIdz5w.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8xIdz5w.jpg\" align=\"left\" width=\"600\" ></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/7b18gLs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7b18gLs.jpg\" align=\"left\" width=\"600\" ></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cbpJGSD.png\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cbpJGSD.png\" align=\"left\" width=\"600\" ></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### LINKS\r\n* [What you will need & Diagrams](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/xDrip/blob/gh-pages/hardware_setup.md)\r\n* [Wixel App](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/wixel-xDrip)\r\n* [Android App](https://github.com/StephenBlackWasAlreadyTaken/xDrip)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Setup Videos\r\n* [Building the Wireless Bridge (in amazing depth and detail!!!)](http://youtu.be/YuxCUeJ9xAU)\r\n* [Generating the Android app APK](http://youtu.be/Xv0PuM7dnYo)\r\nBoth of these amazing videos were created by Ly!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The ins and outs of xDrip and NightScout\r\n* [xDrip, an Introduction](http://circles-of-blue.winchcombe.org/index.php/2015/01/11/wearenotwaiting-thanks-to-dexdrip-introduction/)\r\n* [NightScout and xDrip, how they work together](http://circles-of-blue.winchcombe.org/index.php/2015/01/25/dexcom-nightscout-and-dexdrip-how-does-it-all-work-together/)\r\n* [Building a xDrip](http://circles-of-blue.winchcombe.org/index.php/2015/01/22/a-dummys-guide-to-building-a-dexdrip-wearenotwaiting/)\r\n* [Insulin Nations article that makes this all sound dark and mischievous](http://insulinnation.com/devices/meters-and-cgms/diabetes-hacker/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stay Up to Date!\r\nFollow me on twitter `@StephenIsTaken`, I will let everyone know when updates happen that you should definitely download!
